Hi, I‚Äôm Jamahd Perry, a cybersecurity professional with a background in FedRAMP assessments, compliance, and risk management. I‚Äôm currently transitioning into cloud security, focusing on AWS security, threat detection, and secure cloud architecture.

As I prepare for the AWS Security exam, I‚Äôll be using this GitHub to document my journey by sharing hands-on AWS labs, security automation projects, and best practices for securing cloud environments. Each project will include step-by-step walkthroughs, explanations of key security concepts, and proper resource cleanup to optimize cost efficiency.

I‚Äôm passionate about securing cloud infrastructures, understanding evolving cyber threats, and continuously expanding my technical expertise. Follow along as I develop real-world cloud security skills, and feel free to connect if you're on a similar path!
